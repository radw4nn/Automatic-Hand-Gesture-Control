# Automatic Hand Gesture Control Project ✌️🎛️

The Automatic Hand Gesture Control Project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time, enabling hands-free control of electronic devices or applications. This project leverages the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries in Python to achieve accurate hand gesture detection and recognition. However, it still under the works.

## Overview 🎯
The Automatic Hand Gesture Control Project aims to provide a seamless and intuitive way to interact with devices or applications using hand gestures. By detecting and recognizing specific hand gestures in real-time video streams, users can perform actions such as controlling presentations, navigating interfaces, or playing games without physical touch.

## Key Features 📋
- Real-time hand gesture detection: Detects hand gestures in live video streams with low latency.
- Gesture recognition: Recognizes predefined hand gestures and maps them to specific actions or commands.

## Project Components ⚙️
1. **Hand Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and localize hand regions in video frames.
2. **Gesture Recognition**: Implements algorithms to recognize predefined hand gestures based on detected hand landmarks.
3. **Action Mapping**: Maps recognized gestures to specific actions or commands, enabling hands-free control of devices or applications.
4. **Volume Control**: One module is for master volume control.
5. **Brightness Control**: Another module is for master volume control.
6. **Combined Control**: The last module is supposed to combine both using voice control in order to let the user decide what type of gesture control they wish to use. (STILL UNDER DEVELPOMENT)

## Usage 🧑‍💻
1. **Installation**: Install the necessary dependencies, including OpenCV and MediaPipe, using `pip`.
2. **Configuration**: Configure the project settings and predefined hand gestures according to the desired application.
3. **Run**: Launch the application and start performing hand gestures in front of the camera to control volume and screen brightness
